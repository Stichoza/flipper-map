    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 23, 2026</p>

    <p>Flipper Map ("the App") is developed by Levan Velijanashvili ("I", "me"). This policy explains how the App handles data.</p>

    <h2>No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Flipper Map does not collect, store, or transmit any data to external servers. There are no servers. Everything stays on your device.</p>

    <h2>Device Permissions Used</h2>
    <p>The App requests the following permissions solely to provide its core functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location</strong> — Used to show your position on the map, calculate distances to signal files, and trigger proximity-based features. Your location never leaves your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Bluetooth</strong> — Used to connect to and communicate with your Flipper Zero device. No Bluetooth data is stored or shared.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All other data (app settings, preferences, free trial state) is stored locally on your device using standard iOS storage and is never transmitted anywhere.</p>

    <h2>What We Don't Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal information or account data</li>
        <li>Analytics or usage statistics</li>
        <li>Crash reports</li>
        <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses <strong>Apple StoreKit</strong> for in-app purchases. Purchase transactions are handled entirely by Apple. I do not have access to your payment information. Apple's privacy policy applies: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">apple.com/legal/privacy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Apple Watch</h2>
    <p>If you use the Apple Watch companion app, signal file data is transferred between your iPhone and Apple Watch via the WatchConnectivity framework. This data remains on your personal devices and is not sent to any server.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. I do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If this policy changes materially, the updated version will be posted at this URL with a new "Last updated" date.</p>
